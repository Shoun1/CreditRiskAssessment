Credit-Risk Assessment Platform

Built a Django-based application to classify credit default risk using Decision Tree model.

Preprocessed data with missing value imputation, one-hot encoding, and skewed distribution handling.

Conducted EDA with multi-variate visualizations (distribution plots, bar charts, segmented scatter plots).

Integrated model outputs into a risk dashboard for visualization and further analysis.
